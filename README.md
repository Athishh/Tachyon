# Tachyon
A simple, fast, and lightweight schematics tool for minecraft. 

Instead of having to depend on large plugins like WorldEdit, Tachyon is a standalone tool that allows you to create, save, and load schematics just as fast.

**Note: If you want much faster loading & saving speeds (upto 10x faster), then use fast-serialization branch. The downside is that it increases tachyon's size by 500kb for the library**

## Features
- [x] Create Schematics
- [x] Save/Load Schematics
- [x] Paste Schematics
- [x] Hyperfast loading & saving of schematics using [Kryo](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo) **(USE fast-serialization branch for feature)**
